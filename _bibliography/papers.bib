  title={The Dynamic Impact of Refugee Immigration on Native Workers},
  author={Gallegos Torres, Katia and Sommerfeld, Katrin},
  year={2024},
  abstract = {We study the effects of low and medium-skilled refugee immigration on natives' labor market outcomes. Using individual-level panel data on the German workforce for 2011--2019 and exogenous regional variation from processing authorities' distances, we find that a larger inflow of refugees to a district increases the probability of full-time employment. Fewer outflows of employment drive this effect. The yearly estimates suggest positive labor demand responses in the short run---in occupations that supply services to the refugees---and positive labor supply effects in the medium run---in manufacturing occupations. Finally, we find null effects on wages, the task composition of jobs, and job changes but positive mobility responses.

@unpublished{wgts2024,
  title={Opportunities or Benefits: Local Conditions and Refugee Labor Market Integration},
  author={Gallegos Torres, Katia and Wett, Valentin and Steinmayr, Andreas},
  year={2024},
  abstract = {We jointly analyze the effects of variations in labor demand and the generosity of welfare benefits at the time of receiving protection on the labor market integration and location choice of refugees. Due to a series of reforms, initially, exogenously dispersed refugees face substantial differences in benefit levels and labor demand - but are free to move after receiving protection. Higher labor demand increases employment rates, while higher benefits have a small negative effect. These effects last for 2.5 years. However, both shocks persistently affect internal migration. Finally, changes in benefit levels have larger effects on employment when labor demand is high.},

@unpublished{gtws2024,
  title={Uneven Rules: The Struggle for Refugee Family Reunification},
  author={Gallegos Torres, Katia and Wett, Valentin and Steinmayr, Andreas},
  year={2024},
  abstract = {We examine a policy change for family reunification of refugees. The policy strongly restricted family reunification for subsidiary-protected refugees and allowed convention refugees to apply without those restrictions only immediately after receiving protection. Regular family reunification almost stopped for subsidiary-protected refugees. However, we find suggestive evidence of an almost offsetting increase in irregular family reunification. Convention refugees expedited their reunifications and overall increased the likelihood of sponsoring family members. Moreover, we find positive labor market effects for convention refugees but not for subsidiary-protected ones.},
