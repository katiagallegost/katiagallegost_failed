Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Innsbruck and a postdoctoral researcher at the [IAB Nuremberg](https://iab.de/en/employee/gallegos-torres-katia/).

My research focuses on the integration of migrants and their socio-economic impact on host countries. I am interested in the economics of migration, labor economics, and political economy.
