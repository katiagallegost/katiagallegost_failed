Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Innsbruck and a postdoctoral researcher at the [IAB Nuremberg](https://iab.de/en/employee/gallegos-torres-katia/).

My research focuses on the integration of migrants and their socio-economic impact on host countries. I am interested in the economics of migration, labor economics, and political economy.

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
